# Malware Analysis Dataset Exploration
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (ExpoAnalysis_21pc06.ipynb) that explores a dataset related to system metrics and behavior, particularly in the context of malware analysis. The dataset comprises approximately 58,000 samples, categorized as "Benign," offering insights into normal system behavior. Various attributes cover diverse aspects such as processes, DLLs, handles, and more.

## Dataset Description
- ### File: Obfuscated-MalMem2022.csv
- ### Attributes:
 - Categorical (e.g., 'Category', 'Class')
 - Numerical (e.g., 'pslist.nproc', 'dlllist.ndlls', 'handles.nhandles')
 - Others detailing processes, DLLs, handles, injections, services, and callbacks.
Data Exploration
The Jupyter Notebook includes:

Scatter Plots: Visualizes relationships between attributes, aiding in understanding data distribution.
Histograms: Displays distributions of numerical attributes ('dlllist.ndlls', 'dlllist.avg_dlls_per_proc', 'handles.nhandles').
Attribute Analysis: Examines the spread and distribution of a specific numerical attribute ('pslist.avg_threads').
Boxplot: Illustrates the distribution of 'dlllist.avg_dlls_per_proc' using a boxplot.
Supervised Scatter Plots: Explores relationships between attributes and the class variable ('Class').
Classification Challenge
Observations:

Class imbalance, diverse numerical attributes, and feature-rich dataset.
Limited information from the last 3 attributes ('callbacks.ncallbacks', 'callbacks.nanonymous', 'callbacks.ngeneric') for classification.
Summary:

Classification challenge demands a nuanced approach.
Potential techniques: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines.
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) identified as promising for its ability to handle complex relationships.

Feature Selection Methods
Feature selection is crucial for model performance. Three main types:

Filter Methods: Statistical evaluation of feature relevance.
Wrapper Methods: Model-centric assessment using techniques like recursive feature elimination.
Embedded Methods: Integration into the model training process, e.g., L1 regularization, decision tree-based methods
